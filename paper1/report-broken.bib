  abstract = {Genomics is a Big Data science and is going to get much bigger, very soon, but it is not
known whether the needs of genomics will exceed other Big Data domains. Projecting to
the year 2025, we compared genomics with three other major generators of Big Data:
astronomy, YouTube, and Twitter. Our estimates show that genomics is a “four-headed
beast”—it is either on par with or the most demanding of the domains analyzed here in
terms of data acquisition, storage, distribution, and analysis. We discuss aspects of new
technologies that will need to be developed to rise up and meet the computational challenges
that genomics poses for the near future. Now is the time for concerted, communitywide
planning for the “genomical” challenges of the next decade.},

Like other disciplines in the big data era, astronomy has many V characteristics. In this paper, we list the different data mining algorithms used in astronomy, along with data mining software and tools related to astronomical applications. We present SDSS, a project often referred to by other astronomical projects, as the most successful sky survey in the history of astronomy and describe the factors influencing its success. We also discuss the success of Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics organizations and the conferences and summer schools on these issues that are held annually. All the above indicates that astronomers and scientists from other areas are ready to face the challenges and opportunities provided by massive data volume.},

  abstract = {Large astronomical data bases obtained from sky surveys such as the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey (SSS) invariably suffer from spurious records coming from the artefactual effects of the telescope, satellites and junk objects in orbit around the Earth and physical defects on the photographic plate or CCD. Though relatively small in number, these spurious records present a significant problem in many situations, where they can become a large proportion of the records potentially of interest to a given astronomer. Accurate and robust techniques are needed for locating and flagging such spurious objects, and we are undertaking a programme investigating the use of machine learning techniques in this context. In this paper we focus on the four most common causes of unwanted records in the SSS: satellite or aeroplane tracks, scratches, fibres and other linear phenomena introduced to the plate, circular haloes around bright stars due to internal reflections within the telescope and diffraction spikes near to bright stars. Appropriate techniques are developed for the detection of each of these. The methods are applied to the SSS data to develop a data set of spurious object detections, along with confidence measures, which can allow these unwanted data to be removed from consideration. These methods are general and can be adapted to other astronomical survey data.

  abstract = {With recent observational instruments and survey campaigns in astrophysics, efficient analysis of big structured data becomes more and more relevant. While providing good query expressiveness and data analysis capabilities through SQL, off-the-shelf RDBMS are yet not well prepared to handle high volume scientific data distributed across several nodes, neither for fast data ingest nor for fast spatial queries. Our SQL query parser and job manager performs query reformulation to spread queries to data nodes, gathering outputs on a head node and providing them again to the shards for subsequent processing steps. We combine this data analysis architecture with the cloud data storage component XtreemFS for automatic data replication to improve the availability and access latency. With our solution we perform rich structured data analysis expressed using SQL on large amounts of structured astrophysical data distributed across numerous storage nodes in parallel. The cloud storage virtualization with XtreemFS provides elasticity and reproducibility of scientific analysis tasks through its snapshot capability.},

  abstract = {We describe the application of data mining algorithms to research problems in astronomy. We posit that data mining has always been fundamental to astronomical research, since data mining is the basis of evidence-based discovery, including classification, clustering, and novelty discovery. These algorithms represent a major set of computational tools for discovery in large databases, which will be increasingly essential in the era of data-intensive astronomy. Historical examples of data mining in astronomy are reviewed, followed by a discussion of one of the largest data-producing projects anticipated for the coming decade: the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). To facilitate data-driven discoveries in astronomy, we envision a new data-oriented research paradigm for astronomy and astrophysics -- astroinformatics. Astroinformatics is described as both a research approach and an educational imperative for modern data-intensive astronomy. An important application area for large time-domain sky surveys (such as LSST) is the rapid identification, characterization, and classification of real-time sky events (including moving objects, photometrically variable objects, and the appearance of transients). We describe one possible implementation of a classification broker for such events, which incorporates several astroinformatics techniques: user annotation, semantic tagging, metadata markup, heterogeneous data integration, and distributed data mining. Examples of these types of collaborative classification and discovery approaches within other science disciplines are presented.},

  abstract = {In scientific data management and business analytics, the most informative
queries are a holy grail. Data collection becomes increasingly
simpler, yet data exploration gets significantly harder.
Exploratory querying is likely to return an empty or an overwhelming
result set. On the other hand, data mining algorithms require
extensive preparation, ample time and do not scale well.
In this paper, we address this challenge at its core, i.e., how to query
the query space associated with a given database. The space considered
is formed by conjunctive predicates. To express them, we
introduce the Segmentation Description Language (SDL). The user
provides a query. Charles, our query advisory system, breaks its
extent into meaningful segments and returns the subsequent SDL
descriptions. This provides insight into the set described and offers
the user directions for further exploration.
We introduce a novel algorithm to generate SDL answers. We evaluate
them using four orthogonal criteria: homogeneity, simplicity,
breadth, and entropy. A prototype implementation has been constructed
and the landscape of follow-up research is sketched.},

perform the Southern Sky Survey, a six-colour and multi-epoch (four-hour, one-day, one-week, one-month
and one-year sampling) photometric survey of the southerly 2πsr to g ∼23 mag. The survey will provide
photometry to better than 3% global accuracy and astrometry to better than 50 milliarcsec. Data will be
supplied to the community as part of theVirtual Observatory effort. The survey will take five years to complete.},
