  abstract      = {Large astronomical databases obtained from sky surveys such as the
SuperCOSMOS Sky Surveys (SSS) invariably suffer from a small number of
spurious records coming from artefactual effects of the telescope,
satellites and junk objects in orbit around earth and physical defects
on the photographic plate or CCD. Though relatively small in number
these spurious records present a significant problem in many situations
where they can become a large proportion of the records potentially of
interest to a given astronomer. In this paper we focus on the four most
common causes of unwanted records in the SSS: satellite or aeroplane
tracks, scratches fibres and other linear phenomena introduced to the
plate, circular halos around bright stars due to internal reflections
within the telescope and diffraction spikes near to bright stars.
Accurate and robust techniques are needed for locating and flagging such
spurious objects. We have developed renewal strings, a probabilistic
technique combining the Hough transform, renewal processes and hidden
Markov models which have proven highly effective in this context. The
methods are applied to the SSS data to develop a dataset of spurious
object detections, along with confidence measures, which can allow this
unwanted data to be removed from consideration. These methods are
general and can be adapted to any future astronomical survey data.
