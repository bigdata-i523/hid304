 This file contains instructions to run Rick Carmickle's I523 final project: "How Far have Space Walks Walked"

1) First run Jupyter Notebook "gathering_wikipedia_infobox_data.ipynb

		mission_names.csv
		user-config.py
	The library pywikibot may need installation
		https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot/Installation#Install_Pywikibot

	Code cells 3 and 8 access the internet to retreive and parse data. These steps may take several moments to complete.
	This notebook creates two new files:
		throttle.ctrl (generated by the wikipedia module) 
		mission_data_raw.csv
