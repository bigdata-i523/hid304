        This paper will provide an overview of 
        how Big Data has been applied to existing 
        astrophysics and astronomical datasets. 
        It will discuss the two-way relationship 
        between big data and astrophysics which 
        has seen each field advance because of 
        the pressures applied and capabilities 
        developed by the other.  Improvements in  
        cameras, which capture the observations 
        from telescopes, have opened the door to 
        more detailed imagery of the sky which can 
        be generated at increasing rates and 
        observation platforms are harnessing this 
        detail into more precise astronomical 
        research projects which challenge every 
        part of the big data pipeline.

        Big data has begun to impact telemetry and 
        navigation for manned and unmanned space travel. 
        Major space programs are the entities which 
        control the infrastructure of telemetry and 
        deep space data. The current bottleneck in the 
        volume, variety, and veracity of deep space 
        and telemetry data is the transmission technology 
        uses to communicate across space. Space Programs 
        are poised to shift from radio-wave to laser and 
        infrared communication methods which will allow 
        greater volumes of data to be transmitted and 
        quickly make big data more applicable to this type 
        of data.

    abstract: >
        This project will use data from the NASA Archives, 
        The NASA Open Data Portal, and other available 
        telemetry data from the US and Russian space 
        programs to analyze American and Russian spacewalks. 
        It will calculate the distance traveled, relative to 
        the earth's surface, by astronauts and cosmonauts who 
        performed Extra Vehicular Activities in earth orbit. 
        These calculations must account for orbital inclination, 
        altitude, and eccentricity of each respective mission 
        combined with the start time and duration of each space 
        walk. The calculations will be made in python and a final 
        geovisualization will display an earth orbit map for these 
        space walks.
